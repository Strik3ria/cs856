                    Taniti is a small, tropical island in the Pacific. While the
                    island has an area of less than 500 square miles, the
                    terrain is varied and includes both sandy and rocky beaches,
                    a small but safe harbor, lush tropical rainforests, and a
                    mountainous interior that includes a small, active volcano.
                    Taniti has an indigenous population of about 20,000. Until a
                    recent increase in tourism, most the Tanitian economy was
                    dominated by fishing or agriculture.
