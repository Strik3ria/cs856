                    Public buses serve Taniti City and run from 5 a.m. to 11
                    p.m. every day. Private buses serve the rest of the island.
                    Taxis are available in Taniti City, and rental cars can be
                    rented from a local rental agency near the airport. Bikes
                    and helmets are available to rent from several vendors
                    (helmets are required by law). Taniti City is fairly flat
                    and very walkable. Many tourists stay in the area
                    surrounding Merriton Landing: this area is easy to explore
                    on foot.
