                    Most people visit Taniti to enjoy the beaches, explore the
                    rainforest, and to visit the volcano. However, there are
                    other things to do, including visiting a local history
                    museum, going on chartered fishing tours, snorkeling,
                    zip-lining in the rainforest, visiting several pubs,
                    including a microbrewery, dancing at a new dance club,
                    seeing a movie, taking helicopter rides, playing at an
                    arcade, visiting art galleries, and bowling. Also, a
                    nine-hole golf course should be operational by next year.
                    Many of these activities are located in Merriton Landing,
                    which is a rapidly developing area on the north side of
                    Yellow Leaf Bay.
